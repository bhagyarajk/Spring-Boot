1.from last project we know how to create a spring boot mvc project and we know how to map the requests from the client and some other things as well
2.now in this project we will learn how to handle the user inputs and how to process them in the spring mvc project
3.okay for this actually there are quite a different methods of codings becoz we can use many libraries over here
4. but we will see some of the oftenly used libraries and some of them are very old so will find out the newer replacements also 
5.boom we will jmp into the picture now we created the home controller and two jsp pages one to serve the base url which takes the user inputs 
and other one is the jsp file which returns the processed data in our case its sum 
8.in this case we just created one controller under that only we had different methods but we can do that in seperate controllers also
9.Now first we will learn how to get the user inputs

========================================================================
first method
===============
1. one way is that we can use the HttpServletRequest object to get the user inputs please check how we did that
2. how to get that object well we thats done by the spring specifically webserver here so you will get it just by mentioning 
3. you can get the user inputs from the users and processed now how to send it through the jsp file
4. we have plenty of methods to do that lets learn them now 
5. one way is to add the processed data to the session object and later the jsp will fetch that result
6. you can even make use of url rewriting to send the data to the client
7. now lets make use of the session object and code you can check this method in the HomeController class 
second method
===============
1.Here we will learn how to use the @RequestParam
2.and actully spring will give you the session object also actually
3.now lets check this out in the method "userInputHandlerWithAnnotation"
