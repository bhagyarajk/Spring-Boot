1.from last project we know how to create a spring boot mvc project and we know how to map the requests from the client and some other things as well
2.now in this project we will learn how to handle the user inputs and how to process them in the spring mvc project
3.okay for this actually there are quite a different methods of codings becoz we can use many libraries over here
4. but we will see some of the oftenly used libraries and some of them are very old so will find out the newer replacements also 
5.boom we will jmp into the picture now we created the home controller and two jsp pages one to serve the base url
6. and other will server for the resource add where we will take the input from the user and process it (in this case we will just add it)
7. then we will return the processed data thats the sum in our case
8.in this case we just created one controller under that only we had different methods but we can do that in seperate methods also
9.Now first we will learn how to get the user inputs

========================================================================
1. one way is that we can use the HttpServletRequest object to get the user inputs please check how we did that
2. how to get that object well we thats done by the spring specifically webserver here so you will get it just by mentioning 
3. you can get the user inputs from the users and processed now how to send it through the jsp file
