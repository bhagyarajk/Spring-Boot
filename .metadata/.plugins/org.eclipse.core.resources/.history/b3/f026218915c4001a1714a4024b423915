1.well initially we created a spring boot web app
2.then we know that we will get the embeded web server for spring boot applications
3.now we have creted a webapps folder under the src folder which is bellow maven dependencies
4.in the webapps folder will create a jsp which serves as the home page in our case we have added some content to index.jsp
5.now if you run the application as the spring boot application it will start your web server so localhost:8080 now serves for this spring application
6.but till now we dont have the controller : controller is the one which accepts the requests from the client 
7.okay and we learned one more thing in spring frame work we will have the front controller
8.front controller will dispatch the requests to perticular controller
9.front controller should be configured right : okay thats fine in this project becoz we will not have many controllers will learn that configuration later
10.now just skip the conf of the front controller so just create a controller add the annotation above the class saying that this is the controller
11. then map the requests based on the resources thats like if the client ask "/" call this controller if he asks /eat then call this controller etc thats called request mapping
for request mapping use the annotation @RequestMapping("/") above the method so that when the client requests for / internally the front controller(ie. request dispatcher) will call this method
