    /* create the object for you but when you ask every time for the Alien object you will stil get the same object the reason is scope in the spring.xml file
    	but you need different object every time then you need to specify the scope as the prototype this will lead to the lazy loading thats until you ask for the 
    	object object will not be created for you so for this project mainly look at the spring.xml file */
