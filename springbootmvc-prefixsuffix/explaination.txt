In this project we will mainly learn how you can use the application.properties file
1. lets say now we will put these jsp files under some other folder
2. then the path you can give in the application.properties file
3. and if you dont want to mention the extension of the view files then also you can make use of 
this file as well 
4. why you want to put the view files under any other folder ?
ans: the ans is pretty straight the files under webapp folder are generally public 
any body can access them without even calling the controller just mentioning the name of the file
to avoid this generally web devs put these under the different folder called web-inf

************************************************************************************
One more thing will learn in this project 
1. generally when you return a name of the jsp from the controller  what will happen ?
ans : the ans is simple if the jsp expects any data to come from the controller then that will be sent out from the controller when you call the 
controller it self examples : data from the session object, data from the ModelAndView
2. by answering this question we can now understand about two more classes
3. above we learned returning the ModelAndView object from the controller but what if we still want to return the string name of the jsp file ?
ans : the ans is again simple for that you again have two options 
1. you can make use of Model  object or
2. you can make use of ModelMap object
so you just need to add the sum object inside Model object and call the jsp just by returning the name of jsp as a string
this will automatically send the sum object in background
------------------------------------
to conclude about the model and modelmap we will use these things when we just want to keep the return type of the method as string
