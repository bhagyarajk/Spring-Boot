1.well initially we created a spring boot web app
2.then we know that we will get the embeded web server for spring boot applications
3.now we have creted a webapps folder under the src==>main==>webapps folder which is bellow maven dependencies
4.in the webapps folder will create a jsp which serves as the home page in our case we have added some content to index.jsp
5.now if you run the application as the spring boot application it will start your web server so localhost:8080 now serves for this spring application
6.but till now we dont have the controller : controller is the one which accepts the requests from the client 
7.okay and we learned one more thing in spring frame work we will have the front controller
8.front controller will dispatch the requests to perticular controller
9.front controller should be configured right : okay thats fine in this project becoz we will not have many controllers will learn that configuration later
10.now just skip the conf of the front controller so just create a controller add the annotation above the class saying that this is the controller
11. then map the requests based on the resources thats like if the client ask "/" call this controller if he asks /eat then call this controller etc thats called request mapping
for request mapping use the annotation @RequestMapping("/") above the method so that when the client requests for / internally the front controller(ie. request dispatcher) will call this method
12. In the controller will write the welcome messege which will simply returns the jsp file hold on but incase of the servlets we used call the jsp by using 
request dispatcher but here this controller is called by request dispatcher so its its job to call the index.jsp as well
13.Now will chek whether will be able call the index.jsp okay will check now
14.now if you request a the jsp file returned is getting downloaded so why?
15.The answer is the embeded webser is not able to parse that jsp to a brower ie. client in our case
16.to solve this we need a dependency called as the jasper(internally the jsp has to be converted into servlet you need the library jasper)
17. so just add the jasper dependency so that it will parse the jsp
