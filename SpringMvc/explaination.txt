Here in this project we will learn everything which we did it with the help of spring boot mvc 
thats we do the implementation in the spring mvc here so what are those things which you need to change ?
1. as this is the normal maven project all the requests from the cient will first come to web.xml file 
2. so to make it a spring mvc application you need to route them to front end controller first we already know front end controller is also known as dispatcher servlet
3. wait in spring boot application we used to have the front end controller by default and no need to configure but we are now building a plain spring mvc right
4. for that reason we even have to configure the dispatcher servlet as well
5. so for that we created an xml file named dispatcher-servlet.xml the name dispatcher-servlet why becoz the servlet name you have given is dispatcher in web.xml
6. then in the dispatcher-servlet.xml you need to tell that we are using annotations for our project 
7. you also need to configure the configurations (which we made it in the application.properties file in case of springboot app) so we have created a bean 
of viewresolver class and configured prefix and suffix.
