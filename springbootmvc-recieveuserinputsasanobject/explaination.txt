1. in this project we will learn instead of recieving the user parameters in the controller we will recieve the ready object 
so how to do this the ans is " @ModelAttribute Classname variablename " using this as the method argument will give you the ready object 
but the input names in the front end file (index.jsp in our case) and the variable name in the modelclass (Student class ) must be same so that 
spring can perform dependency injection by the name of the variables by calling setters or something like that but should we need to remember all of these
the ans is no no need to remeber just follow the uniform coding thats maintain the same variable name for same variable everywhere thats it
2. one more thing we study in this project is about using the model attribute above the methods: when we will use it ?
the ans is whenever we want any of the method to execute before request mapping can even happen at that time we will use this annotation over the method
please check out the HomeController class for more detailed explaination
